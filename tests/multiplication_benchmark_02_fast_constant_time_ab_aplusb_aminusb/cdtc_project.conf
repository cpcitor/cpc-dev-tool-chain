# If you use version control (you should anyway), 
# include this file in your versioned project history.

# Suggested parameters to put in this file if needed:
# CODELOC is base address on the CPC of the generated binary
# CODELOC=0x4000
# If your program is big you may want to lower CODELOC but be careful to ensure that pointers passed to most firmware routines are at 0x4000 or above.
# Override keyword below allows things like MAKE CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG=1"
